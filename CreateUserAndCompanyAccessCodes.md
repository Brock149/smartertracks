Idea: now id like to have an create account screen similar to this one, however, I'm thinking I should have a company access code or something, like a referral code, that way when users put in their email and pass, they also put in their company code, and that show we know what company ID to assign them. I need your help to come up with how to handle this with our new company id system. Remember This is supposed to have multi company functionality, so i dont want the access code to be hard coded in, but rather when I onboard a client, I give them their company access code for creating their accounts, that they could distribute to their company and they all could make their own logins. I also figured I could give them 2 codes, one for techs, and one for admins, that way they could distribute the admin code to the team of people they'd like to be admins, and the tech code to the people they'd like to be techs. 

what you‚Äôre describing is a Company Access Code System, and it‚Äôs a solid and scalable approach for a multi-company app like yours.
Here‚Äôs how it can work structurally and logically:

üîê 1. New Table: company_access_codes
Create a new table like this:
| id (uuid) | company_id (uuid) | code (text) | role (text: 'admin' or 'tech') | | created_at |
Each row defines:
a unique access code (e.g. HVAC-1234-ADMIN)


which company it belongs to


which role it should assign to new users




üß† 2. Signup Flow (Frontend logic)
When someone signs up via your new account screen, you ask for:
Email


Password


Access Code


Here‚Äôs what the flow looks like:
Validate the access code:


Does it exist?


Is it for admin or tech?



If valid:


Use Supabase Auth to create the user


Insert a row into your users table:


Set their company_id based on the access code


Set their role from the access code



üßæ 3. Example Data
Your company_access_codes might look like this:
id
company_id
code
role
1
abc123
HVAC-TECH-9Z
tech
2
abc123
HVAC-ADMIN-W
admin

You generate those codes when onboarding a company, then give them both.

üí° Optional Enhancements


Revoking:


A disabled boolean to turn off a code at any time. (I would like to use this eventually, so they can turn off the admin code in case it gets leaked or something, and just let people make tech accounts, and the admins will then promote them to admin using our edit user modal.This is not a priority right now though, wil add later.)



üîß Supabase Considerations
The company_access_codes table can be managed via the Supabase Dashboard or your admin panel.


You‚Äôll need a Supabase Edge Function or RPC to:


Validate and lookup access codes


Create user in Auth and insert into users with correct company and role


(This avoids trusting client-side logic)



‚úÖ Benefits of This Approach
Keeps the system scalable and secure


Makes onboarding simple ‚Äî just hand out the codes


Lets you control access and roles cleanly


Easy to revoke

We will need a new screen, have it link from the login screen from a Create new user button, taking them to the create user screen. Then well impliment all of this.

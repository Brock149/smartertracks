Now I'd like to create some default company settings, like for instance when creating a new tool, it should auto assign it to the default location, ex (Warehouse). Then id like to make it so they could have a filter almost for things like other jargon that means the same thing, like we call the warehouse the shop, sasi, smart air, office, 1455, id like it so if someone types those into their location box during a transaction, it will automatically convert it into the default location. I'd like them to be able to create these filters for multiple locations, for example, University of Miami, UM, Miami, UM Hecht, etc all would be converted into UM. that way when we get to email reports we could send an email of all the tools not located at the default/filtered locations.

✅ Step-by-Step Plan for Default Company Settings and Location Filters
1. New Table: company_settings
Each company can have a single row here.
Fields:
company_id (uuid)


default_tool_location (e.g., “Warehouse”)


2. New Table: location_aliases
This handles your synonyms like “shop”, “1455”, etc.
Fields:
id


company_id (uuid)


alias (e.g., “shop”)


standardized_location (e.g., “Warehouse”)



🔄 How It Works
When a user creates or transfers a tool and types in a location:


Check if the input matches any alias in the location_aliases table for that user's company.


If so, automatically replace it with the standardized_location.


When a new tool is created:


Default its location to the company’s default_tool_location (if none is manually entered).



🔍 Future Usage
You’ll eventually be able to:
Query for tools whose location is not in the list of standardized locations.


Send alerts or generate reports based on those discrepancies.



We will need a new tab for Company Settings, thats where users will be able to change these settings like default location, aliases, and standarized locations and aliases.

Questions: how will this handle the aliases for the default location? If someone transfers a tool with a default location alias, is it handled as a standardized location or the default location? Is it both?

Great question — and this touches on the subtle but important distinction between default locations and standardized/alias locations.

🧠 Definitions First:
Default Location = The location a tool is assigned automatically when no location is specified (e.g., “Warehouse”).


Alias/Standardized Location = Any manually entered location (e.g., “shop”, “1455”) that is converted to a known canonical location (e.g., “Warehouse”).



✅ What Happens When Someone Transfers a Tool Using a Location Alias?
Let’s say:
The default location for the company is "Warehouse"


The company has these aliases:


“shop” → “Warehouse”


“1455” → “Warehouse”


“UM” → “University of Miami”


📦 Scenario:
A technician transfers a tool and enters "1455" as the new location.
👉 What Happens:
Your app checks the location_aliases table.


It finds that “1455” maps to “Warehouse”.


It stores “Warehouse” as the actual location in the tools table or transaction log.


So in practice:
“1455” is treated as a standardized location, and stored as “Warehouse”


Since “Warehouse” also happens to be the default location, it counts as being at the default location too.



🧩 So to answer your questions directly:
Is it handled as a standardized location or the default location?
 ✅ Both — it’s first resolved via aliasing (standardization), then compared to the default to determine if it matches.
If someone transfers a tool with a default location alias...
 ✅ The alias is converted into the real standardized value (e.g., “Warehouse”), which can then be compared against the company’s default setting for reporting, etc.

🔒 This Also Means:
If a company later changes its default location (e.g., from “Warehouse” to “Main Shop”), the alias system doesn’t break — because aliases are still converted to standardized values first. Then only one field (the default) needs to change.

Question: ok what if tools already have their locations set, like 1455, then realize I want to make 1455 an alias for warehouse, will it go back and change those to the new name warehouse?

Excellent follow-up — and here's the clear answer:

❌ No, tools already assigned to 1455 will not automatically update to Warehouse just because you added 1455 → Warehouse as a new alias.
Aliases only affect:
new inputs going forward, during tool creation or transaction updates.


not historical data already stored with the old raw location string.



✅ If you want past data to reflect the new alias:
You'd need to run a one-time migration to update existing records.

🔧 Example Migration (Safe Update):
If you're using Supabase/PostgreSQL, you'd run something like:
sql
CopyEdit
update tools
set location = 'Warehouse'
where location = '1455'
  and company_id = 'your-company-id';

You could also do this for the transactions table or wherever else locations are stored historically.

🧠 Best Practice Going Forward
Keep storing only standardized names in your database (e.g., always store "Warehouse", not "shop", "1455", etc.).


Use the location_aliases table only for converting inputs, not as a reference for lookups or filtering.


Optionally, build a “remap old data” utility in your admin panel when new aliases are created.


Question: could I add a button on my page to run that SQL to then update the exsisting info, like after I add a new alias I could hit like apply new alias and it would run that to update the old info?
Yes, you absolutely can — and that's a great idea! You can add a button like “Apply Aliases to Existing Data” that runs a SQL update to standardize existing tool locations. Here's how to implement it cleanly:

✅ High-Level Plan
Supabase Edge Function
 Create a secure function (e.g. apply-aliases) that:


Looks up all location_aliases for the current company


Runs SQL updates to replace old alias values in your tools (and optionally transactions) table with the standardized location_name


Button in Admin UI
 Add a button to your Location or Settings page:


Label it "Apply Aliases to Existing Data"


When clicked, it calls the apply-aliases Edge Function



🔒 Why Use an Edge Function?
Secure: No client-side SQL, avoids exposing database credentials.


Context-aware: You can pass the user's company_id so it only affects their data.


Reusable: You can expand it later to handle other normalization tasks too.



🧠 What the Function Might Do (Pseudocode)
ts
CopyEdit
// For each alias in location_aliases
for each alias in location_aliases where company_id = X:
    UPDATE tools
    SET location = alias.location_name
    WHERE location = alias.alias
      AND company_id = X

(Repeat for transactions or other tables if needed)

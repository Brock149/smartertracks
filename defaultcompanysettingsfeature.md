I want to give create a company settings page, where admin users can create a default location setting and default owner. I want it to display like our other page displays. I figure we can make a table In the database to hold the company default location, and default owner. The default owner will be selected from the existing list of users, and the default location will just be text, like how weâ€™re currently handling locations in our transactions and ownership. when a new tool is created it will automatically do a transaction where it transfers ownership from the system( aka no owner or location)  to the default selected user, put in the default location text, the stored at text can be N/A.
